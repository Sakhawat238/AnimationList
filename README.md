# AnimationList
My very first android software. It fetches data from a local json file, then show them on a list view. Clicking any movie on the list will show you the details of the movie. By working on this project i have learnt:
1. How to fetch data from local and remote json files.
2. How to implement listview using recyclerview.
3. How to pass data with an intent.
4. How to load images from internet and show them using glide image library.
Currently i am working on the second version of this app where i am going to add bottom navigation view , fragment and webview.
